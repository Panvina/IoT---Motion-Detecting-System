As someone who lives with family members, maintaining privacy can be tricky as keeping my door locked every time could create questions about trust in the family. 
However, leaving my door unlocked without me home could potentially have my siblings take things without my permission, or have my mum finds things I do not want her to find. 
A system has been proposed to tackle this issue. The system detects motion when a person enters the room. 
It will take a snapshot of them and send an email address to notify about the detection with the attached image. 
The time of detection will also be stored on a database for future references. 
This allows me to monitor and trace who enters my room at certain time, and I will be able to act accordingly should I find something missing from my room. 
I could also access the local server to sound the alarm if I find that there is a detection. The system includes a raspberry pi, an Arduino, PIR, a webcam, and buzzer.
